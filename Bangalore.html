            <p>In one of the major heists reported in Bengaluru city, the police are searching for a Nepalese couple accused of stealing cash and valuables worth Rs 15.1 crore from their employer‚Äôs residence in Vijayanagar.

                The theft was reported by Surendra Kumar Jain, owner of Arihant Jewellers in Hosahalli, who stated in his complaint that his employee Namraz and his wife were suspected of being involved in the crime. Jain hired Namraz as a helper six months ago and arranged accommodation for him and his wife in the basement security room of his home. Over time, Namraz gained Jain‚Äôs trust and access to the household, including knowledge of where the valuables and cash were stored.
                
                On November 1, Jain and his family travelled to Gujarat for a religious fair. The police suspected that Namraz worked with his wife and two unidentified people to break into the house and loot the valuables.
                The stolen items included jewellery belonging to Jain‚Äôs wife, mother, and sister and cash from his business earnings stored in the household locker. The police suspected that Namraz may have fled to Nepal and dispatched a team to pursue leads on his whereabouts.
                The police believed the theft occurred between November 1 and November 7 and was discovered only when Jain returned home. According to the police, 8.46 kg of gold and Rs 40,80,000 in cash are missing.</p>

            <a href="#">Extra-marital affair of wife alone cannot be considered abetment of suicide of husband, Karnataka HC rules in 2010 case </a>
            <p>The Karnataka High Court has observed that in the absence of a specific act to instigate a man to die by suicide, his wife would not be liable for abetment to suicide on account of an ‚Äúillicit relationship‚Äù.
                The order was passed on November 4 by a bench consisting of Justice Shivashankar Amarannavar based on an appeal by the wife and her partner in an extramarital relationship against a trial court order which found them guilty under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code for abetment of suicide.

In this case, the wife and the co-accused were carrying on an extramarital affair which was the cause of quarrels with the deceased husband. The co-accused had allegedly told the husband to die and abused him on July 10, 2010. The deceased died by suicide five days later.
The counsel of the accused argued that several of the witnesses were relatives and interested parties in the case, while another had a political rivalry with the co-accused. It was also argued that merely telling a person to go and die does not amount to abetment to suicide.

Referring to Supreme Court precedents, the bench observed, ‚ÄúThe act of accused persons having illicit relationship does not amount to abetment to commit suicide. There should be evidence capable of suggesting that accused persons intended, by specific acts, to instigate the deceased to commit suicide. Unless the ingredients of instigation/abetment to commit suicide are satisfied, the accused cannot be convicted for offence‚Ä¶‚Äù
The HC bench quashed an order of conviction passed on January 1, 2013, by a Mandya sessions court against the wife who had been sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment (RI), and her partner in the extramarital relationship who had been sentenced to four years of RI.

‚ÄúAccused Nos. 1 and 2 had not intended that the deceased should commit suicide. Merely because the accused persons asked the deceased to go and die so that they can live happily will not amount to abetment,‚Äù the HC observed.

            <p>The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) has commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of scaling up and installing cycle docks in 10 more existing Bengaluru Metro stations.

                The DULT in collaboration with Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) had earlier taken up design, implementation and funding of cycle stands and pedal ports in 10 Metro stations in Bengaluru as a pilot project. The installation of cycle parking in Metro stations is aimed at enhancing last mile connectivity and promoting sustainable transportation.
                
                The new Metro stations shortlisted for scaling up the cycle parking include Kengeri bus terminal, KR Pura, Madavara, Chikkabidarakallu, Manjunatha Nagara, Dasarahalli, National College, Banashankari, Jaya Prakash Nagar, and Silk Institute.
                Each of these stations is expected to get cycle modules while some stations will get cycle stands with roof and surface treatment. These Metro stations have been selected based on the station ridership, land availability, the space available for four-wheeler and two-wheeler parking and most importantly, the positive outcome on the utilisation of cycle stands in the pilot Metro stations.

                Following a positive response, the BMRCL wrote to the DULT requesting to scale the facility across all their stations. Earlier in June 2024, DULT had conducted an assessment of cycle parking in the 10 Metro stations. It included Nagasandra, Peenya, Mahalakshmi, Rajajinaar, Mahakavi Kuvempu Road, Jayanagar, Yelachenahalli, Konanakunte Cross, Swami Vivekananda Road and Baiyapanahalli Metro stations.</p>
